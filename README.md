There are two main paths which can be taken at first, Airline and Payment.
Each path takes the client  through the all their respective endpoints.

The Airline  path is continuous meaning that all the endpoints need to be completed in the given order.
On the other side, the Payment endpoints can be accessed as pleased. After listing all the airline/payment provided the user will need to specify the desired company code .

The types of input differs from request to request. Most of the times each variable
will have to be specified individually while some time all the variable are to be inputted
(a message containing the protocol is displayed in this cases )
